Hello, I am BMXLore, although sometimes I go by JackFable. I can write in Java, C, C++, and Assembly, but my background is in Database Administration and I use Python, C#, and VBA professionally. This is not a professional account, but expect to see some fun Python and VBA here regardless.

My main goal is to get the old DemigodsRPG mod for Minecraft compatible with the latest version.
